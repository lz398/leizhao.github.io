### Biography

Dr. Lei Zhao has been engaged in the fields of population genetics, virus evolution and bioinformatics. With a strong background of mathematics and theoretical population genetics, Lei is interested in developping complex population genetics model and efficient software to detect/infer/interpret the genetic patterns conveyed by both ancient and modern data, and to better understand species evolutionary paths. 

Lei is currently working as a postdoc at Globe Institute, in the University of Copenhagen, under the instructions of Prof. Rasmus Nielsen and Prof. Thorfinn Korneliussen.
